# Metanoia
渡我Metanoia is a text-based game with elements of psychological horror, psychoanalysis, and a bit of philosophy.
The game engine used for development is DoraSSR.Apart from the music and sound effects, everything is created by me alone. If you encounter any gameplay issues, you can give me feedback, although I may not check Git issues very often.
