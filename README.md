*No memories, no way of arrival.  
没有记忆，没有来路。*

*Only thick darkness, silent mist, and the bottomless river beneath your feet.  
只有浓稠的黑暗、寂静的迷雾，以及脚下深不见底的河流。*

*You are 亓官渡.  
你是亓官渡。*

*This is your inner world, and also a labyrinth tailor-made for you.  
这是你的内心世界，也是一座为你量身定制的迷宫。*

*Step onto this bridge, and confront the darkest echoes of your heart.  
踏入这座桥，直面内心深处最幽暗的回响。*

*How will you cross yourself?
你，将如何渡你？*

Apart from the music and sound effects, everything is created by me alone. If you encounter any gameplay issues, you can give me feedback, although I may not check the issues of github very often. 

除了音乐和音效，其他所有内容都由鄙人独自创作的。
